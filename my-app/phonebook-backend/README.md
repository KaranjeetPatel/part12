The simple full stack one page app : "Phonebook", based on the tasks of the course [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/), [Programming a server with NodeJS and Express](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3).    
I use the app to test how it works on Fly.io and Render. 

Render is used here. 

[The project is here](https://test-app-react-full-stack.onrender.com/)
